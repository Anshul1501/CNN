# Alphabet Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project aims to recognize and classify alphabetic characters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying and classifying handwritten alphabet characters. The CNN architecture is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of alphabets to learn and differentiate between different characters.

## Features

- Implementation of a CNN model using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras).
- Dataset preprocessing for training and testing the model.
- Training and evaluation procedures for the CNN.
- Inference capabilities to predict the alphabet given an input image.

## Requirements

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Deep learning library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.)
- Other necessary libraries (NumPy, matplotlib, etc.)
